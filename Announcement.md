# Svelte Micro v3 Announcement

You probably have already heard that Svelte 5 is in development, great news!
This version will bring new features and improvements, as well as change many aspects of the current way of writing components.
In light of this news, I'd like to make an announcement regarding this library.

## Version 2

I think that the svelte-micro v2 is really polished and solid in the state it's in right now.
The library works like clockwork, providing a minimalistic and flexible way to declare application routing.

Therefore, I believe that version 2 is complete and it will not be rewritten for Svelte 5, only receiving maintenance updates.

## Version 3

Version 3 will be completely rewritten, and the minimum version of Svelte it will support is 5.

The architecture of the library will continue to be flexible and minimalist as well as the library itself will remain lightweight and reactive.

Considering the innovations of version 5 of Svelte, I am sure that the library will benefit from this, namely:

- Runes
  - the `$props` rune will make the types more expressive
- New system of slots and snippets
  - makes it possible to implement dynamic path parameters in a convenient way
  - potential use of snippets for things like exact path matches, fallback routes
- Improved performance
  - as the result of the use of signals

The new version will be released after the release of Svelte 5. I cannot yet give a specific time frame.

Stay tuned!
